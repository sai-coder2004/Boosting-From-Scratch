# Boosting-From-Scratch
üßæ Detailed Project Documentation: Visualizing Ensemble Concepts with Manual Boosting
üìå Project Title:
"Understanding Boosting with Manual Weighted Models and Decision Visualization"

üéØ Objective:
To demonstrate the conceptual working of boosting, particularly how instance-level weights influence successive models, using manual implementation of decision trees with weighted data and decision region plots. The notebook does not use AdaBoostClassifier, but it manually simulates how boosting adapts models over iterations
üõ†Ô∏è Process Flow:
Initial Model (Unweighted Decision Tree):

Each instance is equally weighted.

Model trained using DecisionTreeClassifier.

Decision boundary visualized using mlxtend.plotting.plot_decision_regions.

Manual Boosting Logic:

Instances misclassified by the first model have their weights increased.

A new model is trained with these adjusted weights.

This is done iteratively to simulate boosting steps.

Model Visualization:

Plots for each iteration to visualize decision boundary shifts.

Showcases how new models correct the mistakes of previous ones.

üß† Concepts Illustrated:
Manual approach to boosting through:

Misclassification tracking

Weight reassignment

Successive model training

Strong focus on visualization for educational clarity.

Excellent step-by-step breakdown for beginners to understand the intuition behind ensemble methods.
üìà Insights:
Even without AdaBoostClassifier, the notebook effectively simulates how boosting improves performance by focusing on errors.

Great educational tool to build intuition behind ensemble models.

Visual decision boundaries are a strong aid in concept clarity.
